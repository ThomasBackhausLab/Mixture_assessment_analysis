Create_InputData_vRep.R

This R-script creates summary files containing measured environmental concentrations from Inostroza et al., (2023) amended with experimental and in-silico QSAR predictions. 
Output file names: Summary_Table_Chile2018_vRepository.rds and Summary_Table_Chile2018_vRepository.tsv

Mixtox_assessment_vRepo.qmd

The R-script conducts a mixture risk assessment, considering three taxonomic groups: algae, macroinvertebrates, fish, and the most sensitive taxonomic group (MST). Moreover, the R-script distinguishes between absolute and relative risk drivers. It takes into consideration three exposure scenarios and nine hazard scenarios. These exposure scenarios encompass no-detected schemicals, while hazard scenarios are established based on the ecotoxicological data's sourceâ€”empirical and in-silico data.
This approach incorporates suggestions from regulatory bodies such as the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) and the US EPA. The integration of quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) is encouraged to estimate ecotoxicological effects. Elaborate explanations are described in the work of Inostroza et al. (REFERENCE).
