Create_InputData_vRep.R

This R-script creates summary files containing measured environmental concentrations from Inostroza et al., (2023) amended with experimental and in-silico QSAR predictions. 
Output file names: Summary_Table_Chile2018_vRepository.rds and Summary_Table_Chile2018_vRepository.tsv

Mixtox_assessment_vRepo.qmd

The R-script performs a mixture risk assessment that takes into account three taxonomic groups (algae, macroinvertebrates, fish) and considers the most sensitive taxonomic group (MST).
Additionally, the R-script identifies absolute and relative risk drivers.
It considers three exposure scenarios and nine hazard scenarios. Exposure scenarios incorporate non-detectable chemicals, while hazard scenarios are established based on the type of 
ecotoxicological data (i.e., empirical and in-silico). Suggestions from regulatory authorities such as the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) and the US EPA are taken into account,
encouraging the use of quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) for estimating ecotoxicological effects. Detailed explanations can be found in Inostroza et al. (REFERENCE).
